# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project I created the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game. I used the Tkinter GUI framework from the Python standard library to create my gameâ€™s interface. I also used the model-view-controller pattern and an object-oriented approach to organize the code.

This is how the app looks once you run the program!

The app allows two players to play together until one of them wins or else its a tie.

There are two button options in the left corner to either close the game or play again!
